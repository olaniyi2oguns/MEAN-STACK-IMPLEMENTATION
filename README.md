Ensure that the EC2 instanceâ€™s security group allows inbound traffic on port 3300 (or your chosen port) so that your application is accessible externally.

- SSH/Terminal Access:
Use SSH or AWS CloudShell to connect to your instance.

## Step 1: Update Ubuntu and Install Node.js 20
1.1 Update and Upgrade the System
